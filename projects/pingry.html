    <h1>Deep Mapping Pottersville</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Deep Mapping Pottersville, a project created by students 
        at the Pingry School. Making a deep map is a way to know a place 
        and the many layered understandings present there in a holistic, 
        expansive way. 
        From the flora and fauna, weather and geology, the native people, 
        the colonists, and the current residents, to the agricultural 
        and mechanical, all aspects, contradictions, and memories are valid 
        and valuable in constructing a deep map of a place.
    </p>
    <p>
        This portion of our project is a digital mapping tool that allows 
        you to record and upload a variety of media to build a deep 
        understanding of Pottersville, NJ. The map is a work in progress 
        to which you are invited to contribute your own places  
        and participate in building a deep map of Pottersville.

        The points on this map record nature, poetry, science, art, and history. 
        They have been placed here or illuminated by people young, old, 
        and in between who have contributed their knowledge, memories, and insights.
