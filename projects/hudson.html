    <h1>Mapping the Hudson River</h1>
    <p>Students in the course "Hudson River Rising," part of The Pingry School's 
        Spring Intensive program (2023), explored how the Hudson River shaped, 
        and in turn was shaped by, human settlements. 
        The indigenous peoples of the Hudson River Valley, who once feasted 
        on foot-long oysters, would be shocked to learn that very few of these 
        natural oyster beds survived into the 21st century. 
        The American Industrial Revolution transformed the river into something 
        unrecognizable.

        As early as the 19th century, artists of the Hudson River School sounded 
        the alarm, painting landscape histories of the region to remind us of 
        the beauty of the natural world and what was at stake. 
        Today, river-keepers are working to clean up the Hudson River, 
        and organizations like the Billion Oyster Project are planting oysters 
        in New York Harbor to help filter the polluted waters.

        Students developed this map as a tool to document their learning 
        about the Hudson River and its environs.
